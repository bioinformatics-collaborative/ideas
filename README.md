Post any ideas regarding the Bioinformatics Journal Club in here

## Bi-Weekly Group Projects
Have projects twice a month that require small amounts of time from multiple people.  Something to keep us working together!

* Request a list of ummc approved software, and send it in SLACK, GitHub, or Email.
* Find people who would be interested in writing something for the blog.  Each person could write as little or as much as they wanted.
